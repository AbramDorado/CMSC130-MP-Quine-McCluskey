# CMSC130-MP-Quine-McCluskey
This is our Machine Problem in my CMSC 130 subject, it is about the Quine-McCluskey. For this project we chose python as our programing language. This was done in the first semester of my second year. This project was by pair, I did this with my classmate.

Python Setup:
1. Download & Install python from website
2. Make sure that you check pip when installing
3. Check if installed by typing "python" in cmd
4. Check if pip is installed by typing "pip" in cmd
5. If pip not installed: Go to https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and save this file as "get-pip.py" in the same folder where Python is located. By default, the Python installation is stored in the folder AppData. The entire path could look like the following:
C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310
6. Type this in cmd: curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
7. Then this: python get-pip.py 
8. Check if installed Correctly by: pip --version (Remeber to check the path, make sure its in the python directory. In my case, the terminal told me to cd to "Scripts": C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\Scripts)

You can also add:
1. Search "Edit the system environment variables" > Environment Variables > Path
2. Paste the URL of python in the list then save


Install Kivy and Kivy Builder in terminal:
1. python -m pip install "kivy[base] @ https://github.com/kivy/archive/master.zip"
2. pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
3. pip install kivymd


Program Setup:
1. Open the IDE (mine is vs code)
2. You can change the Python version at the status bar to Global (mine works even if not changed)
3. Install the font ThirstyScriptExtraBoldDemo.otf and MamaBear.otf
4. Open the folder MACHINEPROB then run screen.py
5. Done!
